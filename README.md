# Covid-19-Measures-and-Events
COVID-19 Measures and Events Timeline By Country taken from Wikipedia

Usage example:
```bash
python covidMeasuresWikiCrawler.py March 2020
```

Basically the crawler connects to Wikipedia API and fetches data for 'Reactions and measures outside mainland China' section
Then it tries to identify country and date and puts them in a csv format.
Currently this covers only measures outside China sections.
Sample wikipedia page can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic_in_March_2020
The data can be used for analytical purposes to combine with active case amounts to see the effects of measures on the growth of new infections
